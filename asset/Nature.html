  <h1><strong><i><u><font color="Brown" size="7" face="Times new roman">    NATURE...   </font></strong></i></u></h1>
  <H2><p>     Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the Earth. It is often taken to mean the "natural environment" or wilderness—wild animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention.
  <br>     For example, manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature.
  <br>    Nature is which that surrounds us in each and every moment of our lives. The Silent Forests , the Brimming Oceans , the Flowy Rivers , the Calm Lakes, the Vast Mountains .... Everything comes under this term "NATURE"! We, the people of this Earth ,are innately expected to love and care for nature and not burn and destroy its beauty and resources... </p></H2>
